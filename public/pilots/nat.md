Natalie Marceline Green is a former staff assistant from a seldom-used blink station on the edge of the Carpathian Line. Housing a mix of Union personnel, independent contractors, and corporate interests, she was firmly seated at the bottom rung of the command structure of Moldova Station along with her coworkers: master of no disciplines in particular, assigned to help anywhere it was needed. Put out an alcohol fire in the canteen, fulfill a supply requisition for the infirmary, crawl through vents in 0.5 g to find the leak, and do it all again tomorrow.

At present, she self-describes herself as a roamer and a cosmopolitan, following her whims and going wherever she feels drawn to go, and goes by Nat, thinking that the full name is very much too formal. She has a short attention span, a knack for mechanics and simple robotics, a certification in first aid, and an irrational fear of swimming pools.

In Landmark, Nat fills a humanitarian role, with acceptable training in refugee management, conflict de-escalation, and emergency medical response. Her everyday supplies (carried in a sling pack across the stomach) include hemostatic powder, burn ointment, and synthetic antitoxin, plus a disposable respirator, a hair net, ponytail scrunchies, and sea-green sterile gloves.

Nat outfits for medium-range assaults, with an emphasis on high-volume suppressive fire. Her aging Everest, the Rear-Wheel Drive, most commonly sports twin rotary chain guns and a pair of back-mounted missile racks, as well as a high-caliber autocannon for reliable fire. If she's on foot in the theater, she sports a pack-fed plasma pistol, a light engineering rigsuit with an abdomen-mounted tertiary arm, and a massive utility sledgehammer with a prying implement on the bottom.

## Appearance
Nat is on the young side, looking somewhere between 25 and 30, with blue eyes, peach skin, and sandy neck-length hair. She is a healthy weight and stands at around five feet tall. She generally has at least one healing scrape or abrasion on her face at any given time.

Her wardrobe is a set of identical gray jumpsuits with blue stripes around the shoulder seams, usually complemented by insulated gloves styled in bright reflective yellow.

She has no visible bionics or genetic alterations.
