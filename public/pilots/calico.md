Former enhanced soldier that went rogue after a major head injury in a testing accident, resulting in the intense impairment of their eyesight, heavy scarring on the right side of their body, as well as significant brain trauma. Their creators assumed that Quinn was killed, and attempted to bomb the testing field to cover their tracks. Quinn survived by waking up, and dragging themselves, and their broken mech out. Their memories start at the point of their accident, in the attempt to escape. They don't talk about their accident. 

Memory, emotional regulation, and ranged combat skills are significantly impaired due to their brain trauma. Quinn does not remember the group, nor do they know that they are enhanced. Their Everest has pieces of the original mech they were stuck in. They don't know how it works, or who made it, but they can fix it and pilot it on instinct. Their last 8 years is a history of "odd-job" work, and picked up the callsign "Calico" from sectors they were active in, due to their distinct scar.

What Quinn doesn't know is that there is an old, broken, and failing neural interface threaded throughout their body, currently controlled by a dormant Comp/Con unit. While formerly used to connect the pilot directly to their mech and feed information directly into their brain, the blueprints to connect the neural interface cannot be found. The Comp/Con formerly gave Quinn instructions and would seize control of their motor functions when they refused orders. Since it is currently not running, Quinn has full control, and no awareness of it's presence. This current state is also caused by their testing accident. The only visible point to onlookers is a small port on the nape of their neck. Quinn hides it, and thinks it's a piece of scrap stuck in their body.

## Appearance
Height: 5'2"

Age: Adult. Estimated to be in their early twenties.

Eyes: Yellow

Hair: White

Quinn is not a particulary tall pilot, however, they have a rather compact build, rendering them strong for their physique. Over their lean muscle is a patchwork of scars from different injuries. Their largest, and most notable scar covers the right half of their face, and trails down their chest to their lower ribcage, and upper arm. Likely a burn, or an intense scrap from an impact. Linked to their head injuries. On their back is different markings, alonside with a serial number and some sort of metal plug at the base of their neck. Quinn's hair is kept in a flat bob, with bangs that unsuccessfully try to obscure their facial scarring. Their yellow eyes appear unnatural, likely part of whatever procedures their creators performed. 

Quinn has taken a liking to piercings, and frequently wears them. They are often seen in a button down and pants, but are never seen without their old, black jacket. At one point, there was a patch on it, but it has now been removed.
