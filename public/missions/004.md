# Mission // #004
## Rallying Cry
# Goals
- Convince the city-states of the HUC to rally under one banner, come to the aid of Evergreen, and continue the war against the Machine.

# Stakes
- If the HUC is not convinced to aid Evergreen, the Hercynians wonâ€™t do so in the future without extra effort, leaving the colony more vulnerable.

# Reserves
- Nat: Extra Repairs
- Cyclops: Salvage (2/6), if1thenstop.exe
- Calico: n/a
- Genbu: Thrives in a Fast-Paced Environment
