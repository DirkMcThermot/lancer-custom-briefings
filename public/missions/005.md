# Mission // #005
## Split-Knuckle Haymaker
# Goals
- Mount a counter-assault against the Machine's forces in Evergreen.
- Put a figurative bullet through the figurative head of Beggar One.

# Optional Objectives
Completing any or all of these objectives would provide a significant boost to our counter-assault, at the cost of lost time.
- Mobilize the HUC's rangers, or convince them to help in some way if they haven't been convinced already.
- Liberate the prison camp.
- Deal with the orbital platform that Beggar One used to destroy Daylight.

# Stakes
- Intel suggests that Beggar One is consuming what remains of Patience. The more time we lose, the stronger Beggar One becomes. [Each time you perform a Full Repair, the Consumption clock will advance.]
- If this mission fails, Evergreen will remain occupied and the extermination of the local populace will likely begin. In other words: failure is not an option.

# Reserves
