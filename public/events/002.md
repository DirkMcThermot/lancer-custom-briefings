# Council Chambers
- Patience, Edena, Brava, and SB all met in the council chambers of the Governor’s Farm, which are now functioning as the militia’s HQ.
- Edena and Brava recapped SB’s accomplishments and thanked them for their service so far.
- Patience explained that they have connected to a meteorological satellite which can be used to capture regular images of the wider area around the colony for broad-theater intel.
- They will also be monitoring the situation around the strange signal and rogue machine horde, though all of that is secondary to the raiders for the time being.
- They urged SB to be ready to defend Evergreen from an inevitable assault by the raiders.

# Knife through the Heart
- As predicted, the raiders struck Evergreen hard and fast. Thanks to an efficient placement of the scouting drone that Edena provided, SB was able to anticipate the enemy’s first strike, to a degree.
- SB performed extremely well during the fight, routing nearly the entire enemy force that had begun to assault the south gate.
- Two enemy pilots were captured (one male, one female). They will be brought back to HQ for detainment and questioning.
- It seemed like as good a time as any for SB to perform light repairs on their mechs.
