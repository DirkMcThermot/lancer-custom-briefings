# Council Chambers
- Patience, Edena, Brava, and SB all met in the council chambers of the Governor’s Farm, which are now functioning as the militia’s HQ.
- Edena and Brava recapped SB’s accomplishments and thanked them for their service so far.
- Patience explained that they have connected to a meteorological satellite which can be used to capture regular images of the wider area around the colony for broad-theater intel.
- They will also be monitoring the situation around the strange signal and rogue machine horde, though all of that is secondary to the raiders for the time being.
- They urged SB to be ready to defend Evergreen from an inevitable assault by the raiders.

# Knife through the Heart
- As predicted, the raiders struck Evergreen hard and fast. Thanks to an efficient placement of the scouting drone that Edena provided, SB was able to anticipate the enemy’s first strike, to a degree.
- SB performed extremely well during the fight, routing nearly the entire enemy force that had begun to assault the south gate.
- Two enemy pilots were captured (one male, one female). They will be brought back to HQ for detainment and questioning.
- It seemed like as good a time as any for SB to perform light repairs on their mechs.

# It Comes to Bring You Pain
- Right as SB was finishing up their repairs, militia scouts reported “something big” moving in toward the stable reactor plant and requested all hands on deck for defense.
- SB arrived on the scene and came face to face with a massive SecComm-era APC rigged up with an ungodly amount of explosives, barreling directly toward the plant.
- Despite all the enemy reinforcements joining the fight both around the edges of the battlefield and from the "Road Train" itself, SB was able to destroy the thing and rout the raiders once again.
- A couple of large CEC hauling vehicles showed up shortly after the fight concluded, and offered SB a ride back to the colony while the lancers fixed up their mechs.

# Elegy for the Dead
- As SB returned to Evergreen, another wave of attackers hit the colony, this time breaching the wall and appearing to target the omninode tower.
- At the same time, another smaller strike force appeared on the opposite side, and Calico stepped up to help handle that.
- The main wave included a refurbished Enkidu frame, callsign: REGRET, that was bound to experience a reactor meltdown at any moment, effectively acting as a bomb within the colony.
- Though REGRET proved to a be a highly dangerous berserker-class opponent, SB was able to put it down before it self-destructed.
- Calico’s job was a success as well, with Shit Heap barely holding itself together by the end.
- That seemed to be the enemy’s final desperate push in the assault, and with that, the mission ended as a success.
