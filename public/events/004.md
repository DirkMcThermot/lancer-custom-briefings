# Somewhere beyond the sea
- Patience convened the key stakeholders for a meeting: Serendipity Blue, Contingency White, and Commander Hadura. Edena was initially absent, but entered the council chambers soon after the meeting started, showing clear signs that she is struggling to deal with the great amount of stress of the colony's situation.
- Patience then revealed satellite images that clearly show evidence of a human civilization present on the eastern continent, including photos of a farmer and an ag-drone, cultivated fields, and even a large city.
- Everyone questioned how this wasn’t known through all of Evergreen’s history, and Patience said they had the same questions. LC’s charter had said the planet was empty. This discovery will guarantee a legal battle for Landmark.
- Despite that, the machine horde and the potential return of the raiders were still the priority.
- Patience ordered SB to investigate a new signal that was different than the one affecting the horde. This new one was a simple tritone frequency, repeating at inconsistent intervals. Its comms protocols were unknown. Patience was not sure if it was coming from a new type of machine, a stranded group of Gray Town citizens, or the raiders.
- CW will stay behind in Evergreen in the event that the colony needs a squad of lancers to jump in defense mode.

# End of the beginning of the line
- Nat was able to identify that the signal was using the same protocols as the call from Dthall Ordo in the previous mission, and that the tritone likely represents an SOS.
- SB traced the signal a fairly long way to the southwest of the colony, coming to a cave and tunnel network with clear signs of the Hercynians having made a hasty getaway - spent ammo casings, nonessential gear, tents, etc.
- Further underground, SB came to an old chamber, filled with long-decayed husks of Egregorian and human corpses. The bodies showed signs of thermal and kinetic damage.
- The depressing sight was quickly interrupted by an ambush from a squad of machines, which seemed to be interfering with the signal. SB was able to maintain their connection to it and clear out the enemies from the area.
- After more time traveling the tunnel network, SB eventually came to a bivouac with a squad of Hercynians, led by none other than Dthall Ordo herself.
- The Rangers had been attacked while scouting the situation aboveground and were hit *hard*, forcing them to retreat to the tunnel system. Most of their mechs are now inoperable and they have a lot of heavily wounded people. Nat offered to contribute medical attention in whatever way would help.
- After talking with her for a bit, Dthall revealed that the Machine has pulled back from the HUC's territory in an unexpected turn of events. She figured it was because the horde was turning its attention to Evergreen.
- She also mentioned, after reviewing some of the intel from [THE BROADCAST]'s message, that the names "Beggar," "Mendicant," and "Vagabond" are frequently seen in their comms transmissions, with "Beggar" being the one that appears the most often, by far.
- She believes that the best path forward is an alliance, with the HUC's armies supporting Evergreen in the war. However, the leaders of the HUC are not in agreement about what their next move should be.
- Therefore, she asked SB to come back to Hivehome with her to help convince the leaders to lend their support to Evergreen. She ensured that she would be able to protect SB from the ire of anyone who still might view them as the enemy. *"I have...connections to the leader of Hivehome."*
- With impeccable timing, SB then received a priority call from Patience. They instructed the squad to immediately abandon the mission and return to the colony, because the machine horde is now on the move. If they wait too long, the colony could become completely surrounded, cutting off the squad from returning.
- SB had to make a choice: return to Evergreen to help defend it, or go with Dthall to potentially secure new allies?

# Underground, as the light fades
- SB made the choice to go with Dthall to attempt to secure an alliance for more strength against the Machine. Cyclops fibbed a bit about a cave-in and explained what they were doing to Patience. Patience seemed concerned about this endeavor, but accepted that it may be necessary after all.
- Dthall led SB to Hivehome and secured safe passage for them into the city. Upon their arrival, a shocking truth was revealed: the egregorian species lives, alongside humans, and in the secrecy of the caves under Hercynia. SB naturally had a lot of questions about this fascinating species, and Dthall answered as many as she could. SB is welcome to learn more about them firsthand.
- The squad has quarters in the admin district, and is allowed to explore most public areas of the city under the supervision of a couple of rangers. These rangers can also act as their guides and translators.
- Dthall explained that there would soon be a summit with all leaders of the HUC present to discuss the next move in the war against the Machine. She and her father - the commander of the ranger corps - are prepared to argue in favor of an alliance with Evergreen, but work will need to be done to convince the others.
- SB was then given a choice between tracking down a missing ranger patrol for Dthall, or escorting some scouts recovering ancient artifacts for an egregorian commander named Terror. There is time to do both to earn some goodwill.

# Wayward sons and daughters
- SB decided to prioritize Dthall’s request, since it was more time-sensitive.
- The missing patrol was tracked and found based on their last known location, and they were under attack by stray machine forces aboveground near the coast of a large lake.
- SB held out against the machines and did enough damage to them that they fell back. The rangers only had one severely injured, but they will all be safely brought home.

# Terror's Favor
- SB then helped a unit of egregorian archaeologists working for Terror, an egregorian “war-morph” who commands Hivehome's overall military forces.
- The archaeologists were retreating from a swarm of angry hive worms, but asked SB to try recovering an important artifact, a Brood-Sibling’s Molt, if they had the chance to do so during the fight.
- SB fought the worms well, and were indeed able to recover the artifact, pleasing the archaeologists as well as Terror, and earning them just enough favor to get in to the summit and argue their case.

# The Overmind
- SB was allowed to visit the egregorian Overmind, Endeavor, at the Dome of the Heavens - the administrative heart of Hivehome.
- Their conversation with Endeavor was mystifying, as the Overmind’s presence was unlike anything the squad had ever experienced before. It was as if their very form bent light and space around them.
- Cyclops apologized for all the awful actions of SecComm and promised to do anything to help. Endeavor acknowledged that the sins of the past may never be fully forgiven, but they agree that working towards a better future is the only path forward.
- Nat was particularly engaged in the conversation, saying she had been feeling a strange mental sensation for a long time, and it had grown stronger since arriving in Hivehome. Endeavor explained Nat is an “empath” to someone, somewhere. Nat didn't fully know what to make of this as her mind raced with questions. Endeavor merely stated that there isn't necessarily a reason as to why this happened to Nat, *"it just is."*
- Endeavor also explained that they are empathetically bonded to all living egregorians, and feel their subjectivities, memories, and feelings at all times. It is often a large burden to them, but they prefer it this way, as opposed to the silence they felt when they first emerged from stasis at the end of the Hercynian Crisis.
- With a lot to unpack and think about, SB departed from the Overmind's chamber. Nat had to be carried out.
