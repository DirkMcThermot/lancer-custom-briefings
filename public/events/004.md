# Somewhere beyond the sea
- Patience convened the key stakeholders for a meeting: Serendipity Blue, Contingency White, and Commander Hadura. Edena was initially absent, but entered the council chambers soon after the meeting started, showing clear signs that she is struggling to deal with the great amount of stress of the colony's situation.
- Patience then revealed satellite images that clearly show evidence of a human civilization present on the eastern continent, including photos of a farmer and an ag-drone, cultivated fields, and even a large city.
- Everyone questioned how this wasn’t known through all of Evergreen’s history, and Patience said they had the same questions. LC’s charter had said the planet was empty. This discovery will guarantee a legal battle for Landmark.
- Despite that, the machine horde and the potential return of the raiders were still the priority.
- Patience ordered SB to investigate a new signal that was different than the one affecting the horde. This new one was a simple tritone frequency, repeating at inconsistent intervals. Its comms protocols were unknown. Patience was not sure if it was coming from a new type of machine, a stranded group of Gray Town citizens, or the raiders.
- CW will stay behind in Evergreen in the event that the colony needs a squad of lancers to jump in defense mode.

# End of the beginning of the line
- Nat was able to identify that the signal was using the same protocols as the call from Dthall Ordo in the previous mission, and that the tritone likely represents an SOS.
- SB traced the signal a fairly long way to the southwest of the colony, coming to a cave and tunnel network with clear signs of the Hercynians having made a hasty getaway - spent ammo casings, nonessential gear, tents, etc.
- Further underground, SB came to an old chamber, filled with long-decayed husks of Egregorian and human corpses. The bodies showed signs of thermal and kinetic damage.
- The depressing sight was quickly interrupted by an ambush from a squad of machines, which seemed to be interfering with the signal. SB was able to maintain their connection to it and clear out the enemies from the area.
- After more time traveling the tunnel network, SB eventually came to a bivouac with a squad of Hercynians, led by none other than Dthall Ordo herself.
- The Rangers had been attacked while scouting the situation above-ground and were hit *hard*, forcing them to retreat to the tunnel system. Most of their mechs are now inoperable and they have a lot of heavily wounded people. Nat offered to contribute medical attention in whatever way would help.
- After talking with her for a bit, Dthall revealed that the Machine has pulled back from the HUC's territory in an unexpected turn of events. She figured it was because the horde was turning its attention to Evergreen.
- She also mentioned, after reviewing some of the intel from [THE BROADCAST]'s message, that the names "Beggar," "Mendicant," and "Vagabond" are frequently seen in their comms transmissions, with "Beggar" being the one that appears the most often, by far.
- She believes that the best path forward is an alliance, with the HUC's armies supporting Evergreen in the war. However, the leaders of the HUC are not in agreement about what their next move should be.
- Therefore, she asked SB to come back to Hivehome with her to help convince the leaders to lend their support to Evergreen. She ensured that she would be able to protect SB from the ire of anyone who still might view them as the enemy. *"I have...connections to the leader of Hivehome.*
- With impeccable timing, SB then received a priority call from Patience. They instructed the squad to immediately abandon the mission and return to the colony, because the machine horde is now on the move. If they wait too long, the colony could become completely surrounded, cutting off the squad from returning.
- SB had to make a choice: return to Evergreen to help defend it, or go with Dthall to potentially secure new allies?
