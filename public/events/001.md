# Ground Party
- Upon touchdown, Serendipity Blue was met by **Commander Brava Hadura** of Evergreen’s militia, who escorted them to the colony.
- The team was introduced to Patience, the colony’s adminstrative NHP; as well as Edena Ji, **Patience’s** right-hand woman and chief ops officer.
- The team was given the choice of assisting **Chief Engineer Castor Fielding** and some other CEC workers with repairing the landing bowl to support offworld trade, or tracking down and dealing with the enemy sniper(s). There is ample enough time to assist with only one of these tasks.

# Bowl Season
- SB concluded that it would be best to assist the CEC team. On their way to the landing bowl, the group was ambushed by enemy forces.
- Nat was able to scan one of them, learning that there was no publicly available info on them, the frame was a mishmash of multiple different models, and the pilot was likely human.
- The enemies seemed to deliberately avoid damaging the CEC trucks.
- SB was able to escort the CEC trucks through the fight and deal with most of the enemies, with only one survivor who fled the scene.
- The engineers were able to repair the pumps at the landing bowl, and SB touched up their mechs once it was clear that no more enemies would show up.
