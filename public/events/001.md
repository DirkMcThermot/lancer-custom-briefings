# Ground Party
- Upon touchdown, Serendipity Blue was met by **Commander Brava Hadura** of Evergreen’s militia, who escorted them to the colony.
- The team was introduced to Patience, the colony’s adminstrative NHP; as well as Edena Ji, **Patience’s** right-hand woman and chief ops officer.
- The team was given the choice of assisting **Chief Engineer Castor Fielding** and some other CEC workers with repairing the landing bowl to support offworld trade, or tracking down and dealing with the enemy sniper(s). There is ample enough time to assist with only one of these tasks.

# Bowl Season
- SB concluded that it would be best to assist the CEC team. On their way to the landing bowl, the group was ambushed by enemy forces.
- Nat was able to scan one of them, learning that there was no publicly available info on them, the frame was a mishmash of multiple different models, and the pilot was likely human.
- The enemies seemed to deliberately avoid damaging the CEC trucks.
- SB was able to escort the CEC trucks through the fight and deal with most of the enemies, with only one survivor who fled the scene.
- The engineers were able to repair the pumps at the landing bowl, and SB touched up their mechs once it was clear that no more enemies would show up.

# Widowmaker
- SB made the call to go after the enemy sniper, despite the narrow window of opportunity and a sizeable strategic disadvantage.
- The team had to locate and help a militia patrol that had just been hit, and they were able to get the wounded stabilized thanks to Nat's medical skills. The conscious survivors reported multiple enemy mechs and pointed the team in the right direction. Calico was able to clear the road for when the medics arrive without losing too much time. Cyclops called on his background as a marine to help the team track the sniper's team. Calico spotted a campsite, and Genbu quickly searched the area, learning a few key details about the enemy.
- The enemies are humans using refurbished SecComm-era military equipment and mechs, and the sniper’s team appears to have been traveling light - indicating that they probably weren’t preparing for a full assault against Evergreen. 
- Even though the team walked into the enemy's ambush, they were at least better prepared for it.
- The fight was brutal, with two strider-class mechs equipped with devastating long and close range kits. Calico’s mech was destroyed after a series of particularly strong hits.
- Nevertheless, SB was able to terminate both snipers and cause other enemies to flee.
- With the area secure, SB reported back to Brava and Patience. They also performed light repairs and got “Shit Heap” back up and running.
- The identifiable corpses were human, and they had been using portions of large insectoid shells as ornamentation. Patience didn’t recognize them.
- Patience mentioned a strange situation happening in one of the Gray Towns that needs the CRT’s attention as soon as they are ready to move out.
