# Downstream
- SB got a call from a **Dthall Ordo** of the “Hivehome Rangers.” She said she serves the Hercynian United Cities (HUC), and no one knows she is making this call - if anyone were to find out, she would be court-martialed.
- According to Dthall, the HUC has been behind the raids on Evergreen, though she personally apologized for the damage their soldiers have caused.
- She expressed a desire to keep the call private between SB and her, and seemed to be under the impression that SB is working for Union.
- The citizens of the HUC (which we will refer to as Hercynians from this point) live in underground tunnel networks left behind by the "first people," the Egregorians, and they are presumably descended from the humans who were part of SecComm's operations in the time of the Hercynian Crisis. *"My people come from an old war, deeply regretted and long forgotten."*
- She was able to learn the modern dialect of Union Common by listening to comms transmissions over the years, but she confirmed that not all Hercynians know the language, including the two prisoners that were captured during the assault on Evergreen.
- The HUC's leaders, upon receiving reports that the first Evergreen colonists were working alongside drones and subalterns, incorrectly concluded that the colony was somehow serving or aiding "the Machine," which the HUC has been at war against for decades.
- After the Hercynians' failed assault on Evergreen in Mission #2, they were ordered to pull back and stop the hostile operations.
- She ended her call with a warning: *"There is a bigger threat coming, one that we have not been able to stop... Look to your machines. We are not your enemy anymore."*
- During the course of the call, Cyclops had attempted to run an analysis and potentially trace its origin, but the brief amount of time and outdated protocols made this impossible.

# Siren
- Right after the call ended, Patience summoned SB to HQ immediately. All around Evergreen, drones and subalterns began acting strangely in the same manner as the ones from the Gray Towns in Mission #1. The majority of them began drifting to the east.
- Patience revealed they had been hearing a signal for a while but suspected it was coming from themself. NHPs are sometimes known to enter these sorts of loops of supercompressed data. Now, as the signal has gotten stronger, it’s clear that it’s coming from somewhere far away. 
- SB will go to Tower 3, a large omninet tower hundreds of kilometers to the east of the colony, as that is the signal’s most likely origin point. If it's not, then SB will likely find important intel in the region anyway.
- During the mission briefing, Edena brought up the fact that Patience is due for cycling. Patience was clearly perturbed by this, mainly due to the unfortunate timing, but acknowledged the necessity of the process. Their cycling will begin in the evening. It is expected to last anywhere from 12-48 hours.
- Calico had to stay behind - they were clearly not in the right headspace for a mission.
- No members of SB brought up Dthall's call during the briefing.

# Machine Shepherd
- SB followed the river-like trail of machines to the east toward Tower 3. During the journey, they witnessed many old machines dig themselves out of their earthen graves, dragging themselves along with the others in a march of metallic zombies. The machines totally ignored SB.
- After many hours of travel, they arrived at the base of the tower’s mountain and saw a clearing with thousands of machines digging a massive pit.
- SB’s mechs detected strange quakes and quickly found out that there were were an equal amount of machines digging up from under the pit.
- The surge of centuries-old drones and mechs erupted, and SB had to extract themselves from the area before being overrun. They made it out of immediate danger safely, but the situation definitely doesn't look good.
