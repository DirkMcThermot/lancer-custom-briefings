# Suckerpunch Logic
- In the brief period of downtime leading up to this mission, Calico removed Canary from themself and destroyed it. They decided to no longer let themself be chained to what they were "made" to do.
- In the base camp, the lancers hosted a meeting with Fielding, the CEC engineers, Governor’s Farm techs, and a variety of other civilians who escaped Evergreen. They now look to SB as their leaders.
- Nat recapped what she learned and documented during her solo recon mission to the prison camp in Evergreen’s depot district. Nearly everyone is trapped there, but there's no sign of Edena nor Laurent.
- Some other important pieces of intel were brought forth, including: disabling the *Cassander* would require a boarding action; CRT Contingency White’s corvette is still at the landing bowl, untouched by the Machine; Beggar One’s casket was brought to the Governor’s Farm; and Patience is effectively being “consumed” by it.
- SB did a lot of strategizing based on this intel and what they knew of the Machine.
- They concluded that the best thing to do first would be to take the prison camp and convert it into a beachhead while simultaneously rescuing the prisoners.

# Tonight, there's gonna be a Jailbreak
- SB gave Dthall the order to begin the HUC’s assault on the bulk of the Machine army outside Evergreen, which gave them the distraction they needed to get inside the colony in their mechs.
- Cyclops gave an epic speech, invigorating his allies and calling out Beggar One, as the squad stormed the depot district's perimeter and began attacking the Machine's guard forces.
- It was a fairly rough fight, but this portion of the Machine fell, allowing SB to secure the depot district and establish an FOB.

# Boarding Call
- With the prison liberated, SB reunited with Brava and CW. (Laurent is in a coma, and Edena is presumed to be at the Governor’s Farm.)
- In private, CW suggested that both CRTs should take the corvette and head to the "Quiet Night" facility on one of Hercynia's dead moons. Eddie didn't reveal the specifics about the base's intent, but implied that as long as SB didn't interfere with their mission, he didn't care. He would then let SB keep the ship to deal with the *Cassander* and return to Evergreen, which it has enough fuel to do. CW will stay at Quiet Night, where they intend to complete their job and start broadcasting a distress beacon for Landmark, Union, or whoever-the-hell-else to come help.
- There was some tension between the CRTs, including one instance of Calico accusing the other team of cowardice, but SB ultimately agreed this was their best option after Eddie explained they were still proactively helping each other.

# Attic of the World
- At the Quiet Night facility, CW freely allowed SB to accompany them inside and turned a blind eye to any snooping. CW vocally expressed their displeasure with the way Landmark treated this whole ordeal.
- Thanks to Cyclops' heroic success on decrypting some of the data stored at the base, SB found shocking information: "Operation Emperor" is a mission that Landmark is undertaking in service to Smith-Shimano Corpro, in which they are attempting to acquire a living egregorian overmind. The corpros were fully aware of the native Hercynian population and the existence of the egregorians before Evergreen was even founded, obviously because the colony was merely a front intended to allow Landmark to get a legal foothold on the planet. Also, there is a modified copy of Patience at this base which acts as a "filter" to Evergreen's Patience, ensuring that they would remain ignorant of any of this sensitive information.
- Nat made backups of as much of the data as she could, including what they didn't have time to decrypt, and instructed her NHP, Penumbra, to transmit it to Union's DOJ/HR division as soon as she had omni access.
- Before SB's departure, Cyclops gave Emma Broadstreet an offer to put a word in for her with some of his contacts in a couple of mercenary companies, as she didn't seem to want to work for Landmark anymore.
- Leaving CW at Quiet Night, SB took the corvette to the *Cassander*, and had to deal with some Machine forces that were guarding it in space combat.
- Despite the relative lack of preparation for a zero-gravity environment (aside from Genbu's *weathering* reserve), SB was able to make it through very cleanly, gaining a close-enough proximity that the Machine's defenses did not wish to fire inward toward the orbital platform.

# Sins of the Father
- Now aboard the *Cassander*, SB crept through the disturbingly silent station littered with husks, both human and egregorian. A dreadful feeling was present all throughout this orbital tomb.
- At a central corridor, the voice of Beggar One came through the loudspeakers. He spoke to the lancers, accusing them of fighting for an “unknowable enemy,” and that he was trying to put an end to all conflict on Hercynia by any means necessary. *"Pursuant to Union strategic directives, I will utilize every resource at my disposal to ***break you***."*
- An old automated security unit known as a “wolf-spider drone” was activated. It was made up of nanite swarms which it used to teleport around.
- Thankfully, SB was able to destroy the wolf-spider, which disabled all the other defenses on and outside the station.
- At the control center, SB decided to set the whole station on a trajectory for the ocean so that this terrible weapon would never be used again.
- The team recovered as many osteomemetic head plates as they could from the egregorian bodies, and departed back to Evergreen.

# Split-Knuckle Haymaker
- The HUC's army was still locked in a stalemate with the Machine, but all that matters is that they can maintain this distraction.
- At the depot district FOB, the squad met back up with Brava. She wasn't surprised to hear that CW's mission was not exactly in the colony's best interests.
- SB decided to take this last chance to perform full repairs on their mechs, bracing themselves for the final push against Beggar One.
- Intel suggested the Governor's Farm was surrounded by the highest concentration of Machine forces inside the city, as expected. There were at least three more advanced looking frames spotted.
- The plan was to have SB move in for the strike, and secure the area surrounding the main administrative building. This would make the militia's job easier, as a perimeter was to be established. This would not only defend against external threats from getting in after SB moves in for the final kill, but also to keep Beggar One inside, should the worst come to pass.
- Cyclops provided words of encouragement to Brava and Dthall, telling them that they have been the backbone for everything since the very beginning. Brava certainly appreciated these words, but Dthall did not acknowledge with a response over the comms.

# Fire Walk With Me
- After mounting up, SB fought their way through the Machine’s guard forces stationed around the Governor’s Farm. There were several deadly enemies, including an elite breacher, an elite veteran pyro, and an elite veteran priest.
- The priest was particularly skilled in e-warfare, and very nearly caused Cyclops’ mech to experience a reactor meltdown.
- Right at that moment, the militia’s reinforcements showed up and helped lock down the area with supporting fire. *"Danger close!"*
- With a newly fortified perimeter set up around the administrative offices, SB performed some last-minute light repairs on their mechs before moving in to deal with Beggar One at last.

# Hellgate
- SB moved in to the main building of the Governor's Farm, following the trail of destruction to the freight tunnel leading past the data center and to Patience's casket chamber.
- Before reaching the chamber, there was a small group of Machines guarding Beggar One, including a witch-class frame that caused Genbu's mech to lose some of its stress. Aside from that, the fight was relatively painless.

# Annihilation Prophet
- Upon entry into the casket chamber, the lancers were met with a horrific sight: Edena Ji's lifeless body lying dead in the corner, and Beggar One, free of its subaltern body, was now an **eidolon** - an unshackled NHP manifesting in physical space. It took the form of a twisted human, and spoke of being "abandoned by its father." A silver figure appeared in the air and spoke something cryptic to it, drawing its attention to the lancers now in the room.
- The eidolon initially took the form of a muddled pile of bodies, constantly screaming in agony. Nat made out the voice of Beggar One speaking in her mind. *“Do their screams still haunt you? Do you feel the waves of memory crashing over? Their agony was the end result of the path that they chose. I merely deliver that which is destined.”*
- Upon destroying the screaming layer, the eidolon then morphed into a large rotund object, and connected a thread to Soda. Calico heard Beggar One taunting them in their mind. *“You thought you were built to be a perfect soldier. But you were never anything more than a test subject… a canary in a coal mine. Even should I fall today, you will not rid yourself of your true ordainment.”*
- When the lancers determined that the only way to damage this form was to damage the mech it was connected to via that thread, Genbu unloaded a shotgun blast into Utopian Pillar. The eidolon morphed once more into a figure made up of roiling stormclouds and electricity. Genbu heard Beggar One challenging him in his mind. *“He displays a calm, collected exterior to hide origins of failure. He was sent to the hangman’s noose, and only yet lives due to arbitrary mercy. He tries to hide what lies deep within, but it must come out, or he will fail once again.”*
- Calico channeled all their lingering rage into pummelling the eidolon, and this layer was finished off by Cyclops, who then heard Beggar One cry out in his head. *“You will be annihilated. Perhaps not here, but one day - your own naivety will be your destruction. If humanity fails to conquer the worlds of this galaxy, we will have faced an annihilation greater than any Total Biome Kill - it will be brought upon…by ourselves.”*
- As the core of Beggar One's eidolon unleashed a devestating blast directed toward Cyclops, Utopian Pillar experienced some loss of its structure. Oz broadcast a final message to Beggar One, saying that his outlook, an extension of the dream of ThirdComm, is strategic and necessary.
- Beggar One's core then attempted to reposition itself for another attack, but Genbu was able to blast it toward Calico, who pinned it to the ground and was about to D/D it into oblivion, before Nat ejected from her cockpit and dealt the killing blow with a sledgehammer decorated with egregorian headplates.
- Further investigation of the chamber indicated that Patience - the version SB knew, at least - was no more.

# Breathe
- With Beggar One now dead, SB made their way back to the main level of Evergreen, where they soon found out that the Machine army turned its attention back to the colony during the fight with Beggar One.
- When Beggar One fell, the vast majority of the Machines simply fell, once again inert. But there were some rogue drones that aimlessly wandered around without a commander giving them orders.
- The HUC and militia's combined forces were able to hold the Machine army off just enough to count, but there were still a lot of casualties and injured. Fortunately, Brava and Dthall survived.
- SB reconvened with the survivors and began coordinating the efforts to get the refugees of Evergreen and the Gray Towns to Mycol Fields.

# The End & Epilogue
- EVERGREEN as you know it ceased to exist. The survivors salvaged what they could and either fled for the hills or followed the train of refugees to Mycol Fields. The blackened, waterlogged ruins of the colony will taint the landscape for a long time.
- The HERCYNIAN UNITED CITIES found themselves at a unique crossroads – the Machine had been driven back and defeated for the time being, but the problems facing the cities were compounding. The HUC commanders began the long work of negotiating a new alliance between the United Cities and Evergreen’s refugees.
- BRAVA HADURA was nominated to both lead the survivors of the colony and take on double duty as the commanding officer of the remaining militia. She was aided in her efforts by the agricultural and logistical expertise of the CH U FAMILY, and the canny acumen of JACOB MERRICK. The Evergreen contingent set up an enclave in the refugee quarters of Mycol Fields and – slowly – began to integrate into their society.
- DTHALL ORDO relocated to Mycol Fields, where she took on a command position in the ranger corps. There were some rumors suggesting that her promotion was a result of her family connections, but they never progressed beyond minor grumbling.
- ENDEAVOR, safe in Mycol Fields, roused from their catatonic state under the watchful care of Terror and the old warrior’s aides. They would not speak to anyone for months as they once again processed an unbearable weight.
- LANDMARK COLONIAL abandoned the colony project and pulled out of its contract with SSC entirely, no longer willing to waste further time or resources on what it viewed as a catastrophic venture. Colonists were given an evacuation order - with a date some months in the future.
- SMITH-SHIMANO CORPRO, in contrast, realized that the critical window for completing its clandestine operations on the planet was quickly narrowing. Preparations began to mobilize and deploy a team of Constellar Midnights, the corpro’s highly trained super soldiers.
- Acting on reports from you, Union expedited the deployment of a full battlegroup to the system. This detachment arrived several weeks later with a mission to establish order. If you wished to depart Hercynia, that is when you could extract. Union would expect to debrief you, but that’s all.
SSC continued its plot to exploit the world and more or less succeeded. The corpro managed to carry out some of its clandestine objectives on Hercynia but ultimately failed to assert a claim on the planet when Union’s stabilization mission encountered the Hercynian and Egregorian populations on the other side of the world, as well as the rest of the Machine. The ensuing war was short and brutal: the HUC fought alongside Union against a triumvirate alliance of hostile Hercynians, Egregorians, and the Machine, eventually overcoming them thanks to Union’s orbital control.
- Some leaked reports made their way around the omninet, spread by HORUS-aligned actors, saying that the Union Science Bureau had retrieved the casket of an unshackled NHP from Hercynia and buried it deep in the bureaucratic labyrinth of Union’s Solemn Vigil–clearance departments.
- The Hercynian United Cities and the Egregorians were awarded full rights to Hercynia. News exploded across the omninet that a sentient, sapient, and organic non-human race had been encountered; the first Egregorians were later welcomed on Cradle, and a long series of integration and recognition talks began.
- Hercynia, once more, was scarred. This time, though, it may have a chance to heal. It will certainly never be forgotten.
