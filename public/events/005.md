# Suckerpunch Logic
- In the brief period of downtime leading up to this mission, Calico removed Canary from themself and destroyed it. They decided to no longer let themself be chained to what they were "made" to do.
- In the base camp, the lancers hosted a meeting with Fielding, the CEC engineers, Governor’s Farm techs, and a variety of other civilians who escaped Evergreen. They now look to SB as their leaders.
- Nat recapped what she learned and documented during her solo recon mission to the prison camp in Evergreen’s depot district. Nearly everyone is trapped there, but there's no sign of Edena nor Laurent.
- Some other important pieces of intel were brought forth, including: disabling the *Cassander* would require a boarding action; CRT Contingency White’s corvette is still at the landing bowl, untouched by the Machine; Beggar One’s casket was brought to the Governor’s Farm; and Patience is effectively being “consumed” by it.
- SB did a lot of strategizing based on this intel and what they knew of the Machine.
- They concluded that the best thing to do first would be to take the prison camp and convert it into a beachhead while simultaneously rescuing the prisoners.

# Tonight, there's gonna be a Jailbreak
- SB gave Dthall the order to begin the HUC’s assault on the bulk of the Machine army outside Evergreen, which gave them the distraction they needed to get inside the colony in their mechs.
- Cyclops gave an epic speech, invigorating his allies and calling out Beggar One, as the squad stormed the depot district's perimeter and began attacking the Machine's guard forces.
- It was a fairly rough fight, but this portion of the Machine fell, allowing SB to secure the depot district and establish an FOB.
