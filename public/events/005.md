# Suckerpunch Logic
- In the brief period of downtime leading up to this mission, Calico removed Canary from themself and destroyed it. They decided to no longer let themself be chained to what they were "made" to do.
- In the base camp, the lancers hosted a meeting with Fielding, the CEC engineers, Governor’s Farm techs, and a variety of other civilians who escaped Evergreen. They now look to SB as their leaders.
- Nat recapped what she learned and documented during her solo recon mission to the prison camp in Evergreen’s depot district. Nearly everyone is trapped there, but there's no sign of Edena nor Laurent.
- Some other important pieces of intel were brought forth, including: disabling the *Cassander* would require a boarding action; CRT Contingency White’s corvette is still at the landing bowl, untouched by the Machine; Beggar One’s casket was brought to the Governor’s Farm; and Patience is effectively being “consumed” by it.
- SB did a lot of strategizing based on this intel and what they knew of the Machine.
- They concluded that the best thing to do first would be to take the prison camp and convert it into a beachhead while simultaneously rescuing the prisoners.

# Tonight, there's gonna be a Jailbreak
- SB gave Dthall the order to begin the HUC’s assault on the bulk of the Machine army outside Evergreen, which gave them the distraction they needed to get inside the colony in their mechs.
- Cyclops gave an epic speech, invigorating his allies and calling out Beggar One, as the squad stormed the depot district's perimeter and began attacking the Machine's guard forces.
- It was a fairly rough fight, but this portion of the Machine fell, allowing SB to secure the depot district and establish an FOB.

# Boarding Call
- With the prison liberated, SB reunited with Brava and CW. (Laurent is in a coma, and Edena is presumed to be at the Governor’s Farm.)
- In private, CW suggested that both CRTs should take the corvette and head to the "Quiet Night" facility on one of Hercynia's dead moons. Eddie didn't reveal the specifics about the base's intent, but implied that as long as SB didn't interfere with their mission, he didn't care. He would then let SB keep the ship to deal with the *Cassander* and return to Evergreen, which it has enough fuel to do. CW will stay at Quiet Night, where they intend to complete their job and start broadcasting a distress beacon for Landmark, Union, or whoever-the-hell-else to come help.
- There was some tension between the CRTs, including one instance of Calico accusing the other team of cowardice, but SB ultimately agreed this was their best option after Eddie explained they were still proactively helping each other.

# Attic of the World
- At the Quiet Night facility, CW freely allowed SB to accompany them inside and turned a blind eye to any snooping. CW vocally expressed their displeasure with the way Landmark treated this whole ordeal.
- Thanks to Cyclops' heroic success on decrypting some of the data stored at the base, SB found shocking information: "Operation Emperor" is a mission that Landmark is undertaking in service to Smith-Shimano Corpro, in which they are attempting to acquire a living egregorian overmind. The corpros were fully aware of the native Hercynian population and the existence of the egregorians before Evergreen was even founded, obviously because the colony was merely a front intended to allow Landmark to get a legal foothold on the planet. Also, there is a modified copy of Patience at this base which acts as a "filter" to Evergreen's Patience, ensuring that they would remain ignorant of any of this sensitive information.
- Nat made backups of as much of the data as she could, including what they didn't have time to decrypt, and instructed her NHP, Penumbra, to transmit it to Union's DOJ/HR division as soon as she had omni access.
- Before SB's departure, Cyclops gave Emma Broadstreet an offer to put a word in for her with some of his contacts in a couple of mercenary companies, as she didn't seem to want to work for Landmark anymore.
- Leaving CW at Quiet Night, SB took the corvette to the *Cassander*, and had to deal with some Machine forces that were guarding it in space combat.
- Despite the relative lack of preparation for a zero-gravity environment (aside from Genbu's *weathering* reserve), SB was able to make it through very cleanly, gaining a close-enough proximity that the Machine's defenses did not wish to fire inward toward the orbital platform.
